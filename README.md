# Query-Optimization-for-Social-Network-Graph-Database
Graph databases are widely used for big data problems and scenarios which are really hard to be presented using relational database. How to represent and be able to query time-varying graph database has been the major challenge in implementing graph databases. In this project, we designed, implemented and tested an improved time-varying data structure for neo4j graph database based on previous models. In particular, we proposed new time tree model for the database. Extra edges were created to achieve better querying performance among data nodes and time tree node.
